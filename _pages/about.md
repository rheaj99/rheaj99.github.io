Hi! I'm a 5th year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/). My research is in theoretical computer science; more specifically, I'm interested in approximation algorithms and network design. 

Before joining UIUC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Anupam Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/) on my senior thesis.

_I am currently on the postdoc job market!_
